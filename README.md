# Pothole Detection with InceptionV3

This project demonstrates how to perform pothole detection using the InceptionV3 model with TensorFlow and Keras. It includes code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Overview

The code provided in this repository includes the following steps:

1. Mounting Google Drive to access data and save the trained model.
2. Specifying the paths to the training and validation data directories.
3. Data augmentation and normalization using `ImageDataGenerator`.
4. Loading and preprocessing the training and validation data.
5. Loading the InceptionV3 model without the top layer.
6. Adding custom layers for classification.
7. Compiling and training the model.
8. Generating predictions for the validation data.
9. Computing a confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate the model's performance.
10. Plotting accuracy and loss curves during training.
11. Saving the trained model as an h5 file for future use.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, ensure that you have:

1. Access to the dataset, organized in the specified directory structure.
2. A GPU-enabled runtime environment (e.g., Google Colab) for faster training.
3. Google Drive mounted for data storage and model saving.

The code includes data augmentation and normalization to enhance the model's ability to learn from the available data. You can adjust the hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, batch size, and model architecture, as needed.

## Customization

You can customize the code further based on your specific pothole detection requirements. For example, you can experiment with different pre-trained models, fine-tune hyperparameters, or use different data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

## Model Evaluation

The code includes model evaluation, which provides insights into the model's performance through a confusion matrix and a classification report. You can use these metrics to assess the model's ability to detect potholes accurately.

## Saving the Trained Model

The trained model is saved as an h5 file, which can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data or for further fine-tuning.

Please ensure that your dataset is correctly formatted, and you have the necessary data paths set correctly before running the code. If you have any questions or encounter issues, feel free to reach out for assistance.
